# 340W Final Model evaluation Repo

install the requirements with requirements.txt.

View the jupyter notebooks to see proof of model training. 
## DO NOT RUN trainAllModels.ipynb. This file is to show that the models were indeed trained by us


### Steps to run the Code 
### Ensure you are using a Python 3.11.X or lower. The modules are not compatible with 3.12+
  - Step 1: Create a folder you want the file to be.
  - Step 2: Open your command line of choice (powershell, cmd, mac alternatives, linux, etc.)
  - Step 3: Navigate to a projects folder with ```cd yourFolderName```
  - Step 4: Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/PatrickErickson4/NeuralNetLesson.git```
  - Step 5: Install the dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Feel free to use evalAllModels.ipynb to verify runs
